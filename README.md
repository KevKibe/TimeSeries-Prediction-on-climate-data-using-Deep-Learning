## TimeSeries-Prediction-on-climate-data-using-Deep-Learning
## Description
- This is a time-series forecasting project on climate data specifically temperture data using a deep learning model consisting of a 1D convolutional layer, followed by three LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, and three dense layers, with a single unit output layer for prediction.
