## TimeSeries-Prediction-on-climate-data-using-Deep-Learning
## Description
- This is a time-series forecasting application on climate data specifically temperature data using a deep learning model consisting of a 1D convolutional layer, followed by three LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, and three dense layers, with a single unit output layer for prediction.
- The application can be used to make predictions on future temperature levels.
- I achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.06 and Mean Absolute Error of 0.18.

## Dataset
- The dataset I used is the [Jena Climate dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/jena-climate) is made up of 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several years. This dataset covers data from January 1st 2009 to December 31st 2016.

## Usage
- This is how you can train the model as I have in the notebook or on an IDE on any of the columns in the dataset.
